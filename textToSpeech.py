"""
MorseTalk - Text to Speech & Emergency Alert System

This script reads decoded Morse code messages from the Arduino/ESP32 via serial,
converts them to speech, and handles emergency calls/SMS when triggered.

It uses pyttsx3 for text-to-speech and Twilio API for emergency communications.

Note: You'll need to update the Twilio credentials and phone numbers with your own.
